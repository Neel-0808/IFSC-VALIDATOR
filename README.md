IFSC Code Validator and Bank Details Processor
Overview
This project is a Node.js-based application designed to validate Indian Financial System Code (IFSC) codes, fetch bank details, and manage a history of validations. It uses an Excel file for input/output and allows users to search for bank details by region or branch.

The application processes IFSC codes from an Excel file, checks their validity, fetches corresponding bank details, and writes the results back to a new Excel file. It also offers interactive options for users to validate single IFSC codes, search bank details by region/branch, or view the history of processed IFSC codes.

Features
Batch Validation of IFSC Codes

Reads IFSC codes from an Excel file (sample.xlsx).
Validates each code and fetches corresponding bank details.
Highlights invalid codes in red and writes results to output.xlsx.
Interactive Options

Manually enter an IFSC code for validation.
Search for bank details by region or branch name.
View a history of processed IFSC codes.
Database Integration

Uses a JSON file (bank_data.json) to store detailed bank information for searching by region or branch.
