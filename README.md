IFSC Code Validator and Bank Details Processor
Overview
This project is a Node.js-based application designed to validate Indian Financial System Code (IFSC) codes, fetch bank details, and manage a history of validations. It uses an Excel file for input/output and allows users to search for bank details by region or branch.

The application processes IFSC codes from an Excel file, checks their validity, fetches corresponding bank details, and writes the results back to a new Excel file. It also offers interactive options for users to validate single IFSC codes, search bank details by region/branch, or view the history of processed IFSC codes.
